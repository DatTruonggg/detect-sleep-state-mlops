## Development Stage


### 1. Setup


#### 1.1. Set up environments (poetry)
1. Installation 
- Open Terminal (on macOS and Linux) or PowerShell (on Windows) and execute the following command:

- The cmd bellow is for Linux OS:

```cmd
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
poetry --version 
```
2. Setup new environment

- Install poetry environment from `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`:
```cmd
poetry install
poetry lock
```


#### 1.2 Install docker
Install docker as instructions: [Docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

We also push images to Docker Hub. You need to log in to Docker by using the following command:

```bash
docker login
```

You will be prompted to enter your Docker Hub username, password, and email address (optional). After successful authentication, you can proceed with your Docker tasks, such as pushing or pulling images from Docker Hub.

#### 1.3 Create a project in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

* Sign in to the Google Cloud Console.
* Navigate to the project creation page by clicking on this link: [Create a project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate)
*Provide a name for your project.
* (Optional) Modify the project ID if necessary (must be unique across all GCP projects).
* Select the appropriate billing account. If you do not have one, you will need to create a billing account.
* (Optional) Choose an organization if required.
* Click Create to initialize the project.

After project creation, your project appears as follows:

![gcp-project-dashboard](/assets/gcp-project-dashboard.png)


#### 1.4. Install and setup Google Cloud CLI
To install the Google Cloud (gcloud) CLI, follow the instructions in this official guide: [Gcloud CLI Installation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install). The gcloud CLI includes command-line tools such as **gcloud**, **gsutil**, and **bq** for managing various Google Cloud resources.

After installation, authenticate with Google Cloud to manage resources:

1. Log in to your Google Cloud account:
    ```bash
    gcloud auth login
    ```
    This command launches a browser window prompting you to log in. Follow the steps to complete authentication.

2. Authenticate your applicationâ€™s default credentials:
    ```bash
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```
    This step ensures that applications running locally can securely access Google Cloud services.

3. Initialize your Google Cloud configuration:
    ```bash
    gcloud init
    ```
    This command helps configure your default project, region, and other settings necessary for interacting with Google Cloud from your local machine.

### 2. Data preparation

#### 2.1 Download data
You can download data from Kaggle: [Child mind institute: Detect Sleep State](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-detect-sleep-states/data)
#### 2.2 Merge data
Because of my laptop only have CPU, so we can make the data smaller for this experiment. This `cmd` below also have a little bit feature engineering step.

```cmd 
make merge
```

### 3. Explore data analysis (EDA) and Baseline
You can refer to this notebook [baseline.ipynb notebook](/media/dattruong/568836F88836D669/dattruong/MLE/Project/Detect-sleep-states/notebooks/baseline.ipynb) to explore the baseline, possibly to gain a better understanding of the dataset's structure, contents, and any potential insights it may offer.
    
### 4. Train

#### 4.1. Set up MLflow Server
To track the training experiments, we'll spin up the MLflow server. The backend storage of this tracking server is Postgres and the artifact storage is MinIO. Before start up the server, we first need to generate `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY` and `MINIO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.


##### 4.1.1. Access MinIO UI
```cmd
make minio-lcoal
```

The MinIO UI at `localhost:9001`:

![minio](/assets/minio.png)

The username and password are stored in the `.env` file. You can follow my [.env_example](/.env_example)

![envfile](/assets/envfile.png)

##### 4.1.2.  MLflow tracking server

### 8. Deploy to GKE
#### 8.1 Deploy Nginx Service Controller

The NGINX Ingress Controller is a widely used solution in Kubernetes environments for handling inbound traffic to applications within the cluster. It functions as a load balancer, directing external requests to the appropriate services inside the Kubernetes cluster based on predefined rules and configurations.

```cmd
cd helm_charts/nginx_ingress
kubectl create ns nginx-ingress 
kubens nginx-ingress 
helm upgrade --install nginx-ingress-controller .
```
#### 8.2 Deploy application service

```cmd
cd helm_charts/app
kubectl create ns model-serving
kubens model-serving
helm upgrade --install dss-app .
```
Wait several minutes until it deployed sucessfully.

Now, we will test the app, do the following steps:

- Obtain the IP address of nginx-ingress

    ```bash
    k get ing
    ```

- Add the domain name `detect-sleep-state.com` of this IP to /etc/hosts where the hostnames are mapped to IP addresses.

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/hosts
    [YOUR_INGRESS_IP_ADDRESS] detect-sleep-state.com
    ```

    Example:

    ```nano
    35.247.165.184 detect-sleep-state.com
    ```

- Open a web browser and navigate to `detect-sleep-state.com/docs` to access the FastAPI app. Now we can test the app
![dss-app-ingress](/assets/dss-app-ingress.png)



#### 8.3 Deploy monitoring service
We use `kube-prometheus-stack` to deploy a monitoring solution for the Kubernetes cluster. This stack, provided by the Prometheus community, includes various components such as Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, and other Prometheus ecosystem tools configured to monitor the health and performance of your cluster's resources.


```cmd
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
cd helm_charts/kube-prometheus-stack
kubectl create ns monitoring
kubens monitoring
helm upgrade --install kube-grafana-prometheus .
```

Add all the services of the IP to /etc/hosts
```nano
sudo nano /etc/hosts
[YOUR_INGRESS_IP_ADDRESS] detect-sleep-state.com
[YOUR_INGRESS_IP_ADDRESS] grafana.monitor.com
[YOUR_INGRESS_IP_ADDRESS] prometheus.monitor.com
[YOUR_INGRESS_IP_ADDRESS] alert.monitor.com
```

example:
```
35.247.165.184 detect-sleep-state.com
35.247.165.184 grafana.monitor.com
35.247.165.184 prometheus.monitor.com
35.247.165.184 alert.monitor.com
```
